**ðŸš€ Declarative Jenkins Pipeline Using Docker**

This project demonstrates how to automate the build and deployment of a Dockerized Node.js application using a Declarative Jenkins Pipeline. The project covers setting up Jenkins, Docker, and deploying the application to an EC2 instance, following a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process.

Project Overview
In this project, you will build a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the testing, building, and deployment of a Node.js application inside a Docker container. The project focuses on the integration of Jenkins and Docker, using a declarative pipeline to streamline deployment to an EC2 instance. The Jenkins pipeline will automatically push Docker images to Docker Hub and deploy the application on an EC2 server.

**Prerequisites**
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

Docker Hub account
AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu preferred)
Jenkins installed on your EC2 instance
Node.js and npm installed on your local machine
GitHub account for version control
Jenkins plugins: Docker Pipeline, SSH Agent, Git Plugin
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
cd project-name

**Jenkins Setup:**

Install Jenkins on your EC2 instance.
Install the necessary plugins: Docker Pipeline, SSH Agent, and Git.
Configure credentials for Docker Hub in Jenkins (under Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials).
Configure SSH access to your EC2 instance for deployment.

**Docker Setup:**

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your EC2 instance.

Build the Docker image for your Node.js app using the Dockerfile in the repo:

docker build -t my-nodejs-app .

**Pipeline Configuration:**

Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job.
Add the Jenkinsfile from this repository to define the pipeline stages.

**Pipeline Stages**
The Jenkins pipeline consists of the following stages:

Checkout: Clones the GitHub repository.
Build: Builds the Docker image for the Node.js application.
Test: Runs basic tests (e.g., npm test).
Push to Docker Hub: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
Deploy to EC2: Deploys the application to an EC2 instance via SSH.

**Jenkinsfile and Dockerfile**

Jenkinsfile
The Jenkinsfile defines the pipeline stages in a declarative syntax:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-nodejs-app .'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }
        stage('Push to Docker Hub') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', 'dockerhub-credentials') {
                        docker.image('yourusername/my-nodejs-app:latest').push()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to EC2') {
            steps {
                sshagent (credentials: ['ec2-ssh-credentials']) {
                    sh '''
                    ssh ubuntu@your-ec2-ip << EOF
                        docker stop my-nodejs-app || true
                        docker rm my-nodejs-app || true
                        docker run -d -p 80:3000 my-nodejs-app
                    EOF
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Dockerfile
The Dockerfile defines how the Node.js application will be containerized:

FROM node:14
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]

**Usage**
Push code to GitHub to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.
Jenkins will automatically execute the pipeline: build, test, push to Docker Hub, and deploy to EC2.
After successful deployment, access the Node.js app on your EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP address.

**Troubleshooting**
Here are some common issues and their solutions:

Permissions Errors: Fix: Ensure the correct permissions are set for directories in Docker by running:

RUN chown -R node:node /usr/src/app
Docker Push Error (Access Denied): Fix: Ensure the Docker credentials are correctly configured in Jenkins, and the image tag matches in both build and push stages.

EOF Command Error: Fix: Correct the EOF block format in the Jenkins pipeline by ensuring there are no extra characters or misplaced EOFs:

sh '''
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@${EC2_HOST} << 'EOF'
    # Commands to stop and deploy containers
EOF
'''
Docker Login Command Issue: Fix: Use single quotes around the password if it contains special characters:

docker login -u username -p 'password'
Node.js Version Inconsistency: Fix: Standardize the Node.js version in your Dockerfile to match the development environment.
